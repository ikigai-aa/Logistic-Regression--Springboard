# Logistic-Regression--Springboard
A Logistic Regression pipeline involving modeling of the datasets of heights and weights , tuning the model for hyper-parameter optimization and checking the accuracy of the model through Grid-Search Cross Validation. We also get to know the intuition behind the Logistic Regression algorithm and interpreting the probabilistic model of it.
